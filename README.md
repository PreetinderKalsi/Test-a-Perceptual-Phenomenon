# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon- Project 2

#### By Preetinder Kalsi

## Overview

In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. We will learn about the experiment by creating a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then will go through the task ourself. We will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, we will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.
